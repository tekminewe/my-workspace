			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository setup into: (1) Create GitHub repository, (2) Initialize project structure (frontend/backend directories), (3) Add README and .gitignore, (4) Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows standard patterns and automation. Complexity is low due to well-documented steps and tooling support. Subtasks help ensure clarity and completeness, especially for CI/CD setup."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Design Database Schema",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Identify entities and relationships, (2) Define Prisma schema (including polymorphism and localization), (3) Add fraud prevention and tracking fields, (4) Generate Prisma client and migrations, (5) Validate schema with Prisma Studio.",
			"reasoning": "Schema design involves multiple entities, polymorphic relationships, and non-trivial requirements (localization, fraud, tracking). Industry best practices recommend iterative modeling and validation, justifying several subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Bonus Engine Core Logic",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Design service layer structure, (2) Implement bonus lifecycle management, (3) Develop rule evaluation engine, (4) Integrate with database, (5) Add TypeScript type safety, (6) Write unit tests with Jest.",
			"reasoning": "Core business logic with rule engines and lifecycle management is inherently complex, requiring careful design, modularization, and thorough testing. Multiple subtasks are needed to address each concern and ensure maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Admin Configuration System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Set up Next.js project, (2) Implement authentication/authorization, (3) Build CRUD UI for bonus templates, (4) Add localization and fraud settings UI, (5) Integrate GraphQL data layer, (6) Write Cypress end-to-end tests.",
			"reasoning": "Building a secure, feature-rich admin dashboard with CRUD, localization, and integration with backend services is moderately complex. Best practices suggest separating concerns and ensuring robust testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create User Experience Layer",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Design bonus center UI/UX, (2) Implement React components for bonus display, (3) Integrate GraphQL APIs, (4) Ensure responsive/mobile design, (5) Conduct user acceptance testing.",
			"reasoning": "User-facing components require attention to UX, responsiveness, and backend integration. While not as complex as core logic, multiple subtasks are needed to address design, implementation, and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Notification System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Analyze notification requirements, (2) Implement notification triggers in bonus engine, (3) Integrate with notification API, (4) Test notification delivery and accuracy.",
			"reasoning": "Integration tasks are moderately complex, especially when ensuring correct event triggers and message delivery. Subtasks help manage requirements, implementation, and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Fraud Prevention Measures",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Research and select fraud prevention techniques, (2) Integrate device fingerprinting, (3) Implement email domain validation, (4) Add IP-based restrictions, (5) Test fraud scenarios and legitimate flows.",
			"reasoning": "Fraud prevention involves integrating third-party libraries, implementing multiple checks, and balancing security with user experience. Each technique warrants a dedicated subtask for clarity and testability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Email Notification Templates",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Design email templates for each event, (2) Implement localization, (3) Integrate Mailgun with backend, (4) Test email rendering and delivery.",
			"reasoning": "Email template setup is straightforward but requires attention to localization and integration. Subtasks ensure coverage of template design, localization, integration, and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Analytics and Reporting",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Define KPIs and reporting requirements, (2) Set up analytics data collection, (3) Implement dashboard UI, (4) Integrate with analytics tools or custom backend, (5) Validate data accuracy and real-time updates.",
			"reasoning": "Analytics requires both backend data handling and frontend visualization. Industry standards recommend clear separation of data collection, processing, and presentation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Conduct Security and Compliance Audit",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Review architecture for vulnerabilities, (2) Assess GDPR and legal compliance, (3) Conduct penetration testing, (4) Perform code reviews, (5) Document findings and recommendations, (6) Verify remediation of issues.",
			"reasoning": "Security and compliance audits are complex, requiring specialized knowledge, multiple assessment techniques, and thorough documentation. Each aspect (architecture, legal, testing) should be a subtask."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Perform Load Testing and Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Define load scenarios and benchmarks, (2) Set up load testing tools, (3) Execute tests and collect metrics, (4) Identify and address bottlenecks, (5) Re-test to confirm optimizations.",
			"reasoning": "Load testing and optimization involve iterative testing and tuning. Subtasks help structure the process from scenario definition to validation of improvements."
