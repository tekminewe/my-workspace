Created WelcomeBonusEligibilityService with 7 distinct rules:\n\n1. No Existing Bonus - Ensures user doesn't already have a welcome bonus\n2. Welcome Bonus Enabled - Checks if feature is enabled for the site\n3. Daily Grant Limit - Prevents exceeding daily bonus grants\n4. User Account Age - Prevents immediate bonus farming (1-minute minimum age)\n5. IP Address Fraud Check - Limits bonuses per IP (max 3 per 24h)\n6. Device Fraud Check - Limits bonuses per device fingerprint (max 2 per 24h)\n7. User Status Check - Validates user account status and optional email verification\n\nFeatures implemented:\n- Detailed eligibility checking with rule-by-rule results\n- Simple eligibility checking for backward compatibility\n- Comprehensive fraud prevention measures\n- Configurable settings per site\n- Full test coverage (8 passing tests)\n- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated eligibility service\n- Integration with main WelcomeBonusService\n\nAll tests pass and the service is production-ready with robust fraud detection.\n</info added on 2025-08-05T09:21:56.123Z>",
