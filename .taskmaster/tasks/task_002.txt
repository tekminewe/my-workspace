# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement the database schema for the Generic Bonus Engine.
# Details:
Use Prisma to define the database schema for bonus templates, user bonuses, and related entities. Ensure the schema supports polymorphic bonus types and includes fields for localization, fraud prevention, and tracking configuration. Generate the Prisma client and apply migrations to the database.

# Test Strategy:
Run database migrations and verify the schema using Prisma Studio. Ensure all tables and relationships are correctly created.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Core Bonus Engine Entities in Prisma Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and model the primary entities required for the Generic Bonus Engine, such as bonus templates, user bonuses, and their relationships, using the Prisma Schema Language.
### Details:
Analyze requirements to enumerate all core entities and their attributes. Use Prisma's declarative syntax to define models, primary keys, and relationships in the schema.prisma file.

## 2. Implement Polymorphic Bonus Type Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Design the schema to support multiple bonus types (e.g., cashback, free spins) using polymorphic patterns suitable for Prisma.
### Details:
Choose an appropriate polymorphic modeling strategy (e.g., single-table inheritance, type fields, or related tables) and implement it in the Prisma schema to allow extensibility for new bonus types.

## 3. Add Localization, Fraud Prevention, and Tracking Fields [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Extend the schema to include fields for localization (e.g., multi-language support), fraud prevention (e.g., device/user identifiers), and tracking configuration.
### Details:
Identify necessary fields for each concern (such as language codes, fraud flags, tracking tokens) and add them to the relevant models in the Prisma schema.

## 4. Generate Prisma Client and Apply Database Migrations [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Use Prisma CLI to generate the Prisma Client and apply schema migrations to the target database.
### Details:
Run `prisma generate` to create the client and `prisma migrate dev` (or `prisma db push` if using PlanetScale) to apply schema changes, ensuring the database structure matches the schema definition.

## 5. Verify and Document Schema Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Review the implemented schema for completeness, correctness, and maintainability, and document the schema structure and design decisions.
### Details:
Perform a final review of the schema, update documentation to describe each model and field, and outline how polymorphism, localization, fraud prevention, and tracking are handled.
