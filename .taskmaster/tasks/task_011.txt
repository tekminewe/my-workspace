# Task ID: 11
# Title: Perform Load Testing and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct load testing to ensure the system can handle expected traffic and optimize performance.
# Details:
Use tools like Apache JMeter or k6 to simulate high traffic scenarios and measure system performance. Identify bottlenecks and optimize code and infrastructure to improve scalability.

# Test Strategy:
Analyze load test results to ensure the system meets performance benchmarks. Implement optimizations and re-test to confirm improvements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Load Testing Requirements and Benchmarks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the expected traffic patterns, performance benchmarks, and key system metrics to be validated during load testing.
### Details:
Gather business and technical requirements to determine peak user loads, acceptable response times, throughput targets, and resource utilization thresholds. Document these as success criteria for the load tests.

## 2. Design Load Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create realistic load test scenarios that simulate expected and peak user behaviors using selected tools such as Apache JMeter or k6.
### Details:
Develop test scripts to model user journeys, concurrent sessions, and request patterns. Ensure scenarios cover both typical and edge-case usage, leveraging the scripting capabilities and protocol support of the chosen tool.

## 3. Execute Load Tests and Collect Performance Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Run the designed load tests in a controlled environment and gather detailed performance metrics.
### Details:
Use JMeter or k6 to execute the scenarios, monitoring system metrics such as response times, error rates, CPU/memory usage, and throughput. Ensure tests are repeatable and results are consistently logged.

## 4. Analyze Results and Identify Bottlenecks [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Interpret the collected data to pinpoint system bottlenecks and performance issues.
### Details:
Review logs and reports to identify slow endpoints, resource constraints, or scalability limitations. Correlate findings with system architecture to determine root causes.

## 5. Optimize System and Validate Improvements [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Implement targeted optimizations in code and infrastructure, then re-test to confirm performance gains.
### Details:
Apply fixes such as code refactoring, database tuning, or scaling infrastructure. Re-run load tests to verify that optimizations resolve identified bottlenecks and that the system meets defined benchmarks.
