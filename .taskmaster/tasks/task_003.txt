# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Bonus Engine Core Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the core logic for the bonus engine, including rule evaluation and lifecycle management.
# Details:
Create a service layer in the backend to handle bonus lifecycle events such as creation, activation, and claiming. Implement the rule engine to evaluate eligibility and claiming conditions based on user actions and predefined rules. Use TypeScript for type safety and NestJS for structuring the service.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the bonus engine logic using Jest. Ensure all rule evaluations and lifecycle transitions work as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Bonus Lifecycle Service Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dedicated service layer in NestJS to manage bonus lifecycle events such as creation, activation, and claiming.
### Details:
Define service methods for each lifecycle event and ensure integration with the database and other relevant modules. Use TypeScript for type safety and follow NestJS best practices for service encapsulation.

## 2. Implement Rule Engine for Eligibility Evaluation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop a rule engine component to evaluate user eligibility and claiming conditions based on predefined rules and user actions.
### Details:
Design a flexible rule evaluation system that can process various rule types and user action triggers. Ensure the engine can be extended with new rule types as needed.

## 3. Integrate Bonus Lifecycle with Rule Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Connect the service layer with the rule engine to ensure that lifecycle events trigger rule evaluations and that only eligible users can claim bonuses.
### Details:
Implement logic to invoke rule checks during activation and claiming, and handle outcomes appropriately within the service layer.

## 4. Define and Register Bonus Event Handlers [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.3
### Description: Set up event handlers in NestJS to respond to bonus-related events and manage state transitions within the bonus engine.
### Details:
Use NestJS event system or Observables to listen for and handle events such as bonus creation, activation, and claiming, ensuring proper state management.

## 5. Document and Validate Bonus Engine API [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Document the service API and validate endpoints for managing bonuses, including lifecycle operations and rule evaluation endpoints.
### Details:
Use Swagger or similar tools to generate API documentation and ensure all endpoints are well-described and tested for expected input/output.
