# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Admin Configuration System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the admin interface for managing bonus templates and configurations.
# Details:
Create a React-based admin dashboard using Next.js. Implement CRUD operations for bonus templates, including localization and fraud prevention settings. Use GraphQL for data fetching and mutations, and integrate with the backend services.

# Test Strategy:
Perform end-to-end testing of the admin interface using Cypress. Verify that all CRUD operations work correctly and that changes are reflected in the database.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Next.js Admin Dashboard Project [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a new Next.js project and configure the development environment for the admin dashboard.
### Details:
Install Node.js and npm, create a Next.js app, and add essential UI libraries such as Material-UI or Shadcn/ui for styling and layout. Organize the project structure to support scalable admin features.

## 2. Design and Implement Bonus Template CRUD UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop React components for creating, reading, updating, and deleting bonus templates, including forms and tables.
### Details:
Build modular components for listing bonus templates, editing details, and handling form validation. Ensure the UI supports localization fields and integrates with the overall dashboard layout.

## 3. Integrate GraphQL Data Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Connect the admin dashboard to backend services using GraphQL for data fetching and mutations related to bonus templates and configurations.
### Details:
Set up Apollo Client or a similar GraphQL client in the Next.js project. Implement queries and mutations for all CRUD operations, and handle loading and error states in the UI.

## 4. Implement Localization and Fraud Prevention Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Add UI and backend integration for managing localization (multi-language support) and fraud prevention settings within bonus templates.
### Details:
Extend bonus template forms to include localization fields (e.g., language-specific labels) and fraud prevention options (e.g., device/IP restrictions). Ensure these settings are persisted via GraphQL mutations.

## 5. Conduct End-to-End Testing of Admin Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive end-to-end tests to validate all admin dashboard features and data flows.
### Details:
Use Cypress to automate user flows for CRUD operations, localization, and fraud prevention settings. Verify that all changes are accurately reflected in the database and UI.
