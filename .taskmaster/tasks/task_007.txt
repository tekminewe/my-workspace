# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Fraud Prevention Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and integrate fraud prevention mechanisms into the bonus engine.
# Details:
Implement device fingerprinting, email domain validation, and IP-based restrictions to prevent bonus abuse. Use libraries like FingerprintJS for device identification and integrate these checks into the bonus claiming process.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate fraudulent activities and verify that the system correctly identifies and prevents them. Ensure legitimate users can claim bonuses without issues.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Device Fingerprinting with Bonus Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement device fingerprinting using FingerprintJS to uniquely identify user devices during the bonus claiming process.
### Details:
Install and configure the FingerprintJS library in the application. Capture the device fingerprint (visitorId) at the point of bonus claim and associate it with the user's claim attempt.

## 2. Implement Email Domain Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop logic to validate email domains during bonus registration and claiming to block disposable or suspicious email providers.
### Details:
Integrate a list of known disposable and high-risk email domains. Check user email addresses against this list during the bonus claim process and reject claims from invalid domains.

## 3. Enforce IP-Based Restrictions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add IP address checks to limit bonus claims from the same IP or from known proxy/VPN sources.
### Details:
Capture the user's IP address at the time of claim. Implement logic to restrict multiple claims from the same IP within a defined period and optionally block claims from known proxy or VPN IP ranges.

## 4. Integrate Fraud Checks into Bonus Claim Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Combine device fingerprinting, email domain validation, and IP-based checks into the bonus engine's claim logic.
### Details:
Modify the bonus claim service to sequentially apply all fraud prevention checks before processing a claim. Ensure that any failed check results in claim rejection with an appropriate error message.

## 5. Develop Fraud Prevention Monitoring and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Implement monitoring and logging for all fraud prevention mechanisms to support auditing and incident response.
### Details:
Log all failed and successful fraud checks with relevant metadata (device ID, email, IP, timestamp). Set up alerts for suspicious activity patterns, such as repeated failed attempts.
