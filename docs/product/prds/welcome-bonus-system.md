## Executive Summary

The Welcome Bonus System is a foundational user acquisition feature that provides new users with an immediate $5 bonus upon email verification. This incentive reduces signup friction, encourages first purchases, and improves early user engagement. The feature is critical for converting visitors into active users and establishing trust in the cashback platform.

## Background & Context

### Problem Statement

New users joining cashback platforms often experience hesitation about making their first purchase due to uncertainty about the service's legitimacy and value proposition. Without immediate value demonstration, signup-to-first-purchase conversion rates remain low, increasing customer acquisition costs.

### Current State

- Users must complete signup and make a purchase before seeing any cashback value
- No immediate incentive for new user activation
- High drop-off rates between signup and first purchase
- Limited tools for acquisition campaigns

### Strategic Goals

- Reduce time-to-value for new users
- Increase signup-to-first-purchase conversion rates
- Establish trust and credibility early in user journey
- Create viral growth through positive early experiences

## Product Vision & Objectives

### Success Criteria

- **Primary**: 25% increase in signup-to-first-purchase conversion rate
- **Secondary**: 15% improvement in 30-day user retention
- **Operational**: Maintain fraud rate below 2% of total bonuses granted

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Bonus utilization rate (target: >60%)
- Time from signup to first purchase (target: <7 days)
- User lifetime value for bonus recipients vs. non-recipients
