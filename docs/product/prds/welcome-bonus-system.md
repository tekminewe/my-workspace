## Executive Summary

The Welcome Bonus System is a foundational user acquisition feature that provides new users with an achievement-based bonus that they can claim after earning equivalent cashback through actual platform usage. This gamified approach encourages genuine engagement, reduces fraud, and ensures users understand the platform's value before receiving rewards. The feature transforms from immediate gratification to earned achievement, creating better user quality and retention.

## Background & Context

### Problem Statement

New users joining cashback platforms often experience hesitation about making their first purchase due to uncertainty about the service's legitimacy and value proposition. Traditional immediate bonuses can be abused by fraudulent signups and don't ensure genuine user engagement. Without earned value demonstration, users may claim bonuses without understanding the platform's core benefits, leading to low retention and high acquisition costs.

### Current State

- Users must complete signup and make a purchase before seeing any cashback value
- No immediate incentive for new user activation
- High drop-off rates between signup and first purchase
- Limited tools for acquisition campaigns
- Risk of bonus abuse from fraudulent signups
- No requirement for users to understand platform value before receiving rewards

### Strategic Goals

- Reduce time-to-value for new users
- Increase signup-to-first-purchase conversion rates
- Establish trust and credibility early in user journey
- Create viral growth through positive early experiences

## Product Vision & Objectives

### Vision Statement

Provide every new user with immediate, tangible value that demonstrates our platform's benefits while incentivizing meaningful engagement and first purchases through an achievement-based reward system.

### Success Criteria

- **Primary**: 25% increase in signup-to-first-purchase conversion rate
- **Secondary**: 15% improvement in 30-day user retention
- **Operational**: Maintain fraud rate below 2% of total bonuses granted
- **Engagement**: 80% of users who earn the threshold amount proceed to claim their bonus

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Bonus utilization rate (target: >60%)
- Time from signup to first purchase (target: <7 days)
- User lifetime value for bonus recipients vs. non-recipients
- Cost per acquisition reduction (target: 20%)
