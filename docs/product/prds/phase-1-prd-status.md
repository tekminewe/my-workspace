- References to technical documentation
- Compliance and legal requirements

## Key Features Across All PRDs

### 🔗 Cross-Feature Integration
All PRDs are designed to work together with clear dependency mapping:
- **Analytics** tracks all other features
- **Security** protects all user data and transactions
- **Email** supports all user communication needs
- **Social features** integrate with referrals and sharing
- **Bonus system** ties into referrals and social engagement

### 🎯 Business Value Focus
Each PRD clearly articulates:
- User acquisition impact
- Revenue generation potential
- User engagement improvements
- Competitive advantages

### 🛠 Technical Implementation
Consistent technical patterns across all PRDs:
- TypeScript interfaces and schemas
- Database design standards
- API endpoint conventions
- Component architecture

### 📊 Measurable Success
Every PRD includes:
- Specific success metrics
- KPI targets with timelines
- Monitoring and evaluation plans
- Post-launch optimization strategies

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Link PRDs to GitHub Issues**: Update each issue description with PRD links
2. **Engineering Review**: Technical team review of all PRD specifications
3. **Design Review**: UX/UI team review of user experience requirements
4. **Project Planning**: Break down PRDs into development sprints

### Development Phase
1. **Sprint Planning**: Organize features into 2-week sprints
2. **Technical Architecture**: Implement shared infrastructure first
3. **Feature Development**: Build features according to PRD specifications
4. **Testing & QA**: Validate against PRD acceptance criteria

### Success Tracking
1. **Metrics Implementation**: Set up tracking per PRD success criteria
2. **A/B Testing**: Implement experiments as specified in PRDs
3. **User Feedback**: Collect and analyze user feedback against PRD assumptions
4. **Iteration Planning**: Use PRD frameworks for feature iterations

## PRD Template Usage

The standardized PRD template has proven effective for:
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects of feature development covered
- ✅ **Consistent Structure**: Easy navigation and comparison across features
- ✅ **Technical Clarity**: Clear specifications for engineering implementation
- ✅ **Business Alignment**: Strong connection between features and business goals
- ✅ **Stakeholder Communication**: Accessible format for all team members

## Project Management Integration

### GitHub Projects Integration
- **Board:** [Acquisition Strategy & Feature Development](https://github.com/users/tekminewe/projects/1)
- **PRD References:** Each issue now links to its corresponding PRD
- **Development Tracking:** PRDs provide acceptance criteria for issue completion
- **Sprint Planning:** PRD implementation plans guide sprint organization
