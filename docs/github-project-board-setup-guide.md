### **Step 3: Configure Initial Columns**

Create these columns in order (you can drag to reorder later):

#### üìã **Backlog**

#### üöÄ **Phase 1: In Progress**

- **Purpose**: Active development work
- **Description**: "Foundation + Social features currently being developed"

#### üëÄ **Review & Testing**

- **Purpose**: Completed development awaiting review

### **Step 5: Configure Project Settings**

#### **Automation Rules**

Set up these automations in Project Settings:

1. **Auto-move to "In Progress"**

   - **When**: Issue is assigned
   - **Then**: Move to "Phase 1: In Progress"

2. **Auto-move to "Review & Testing"**

   - **When**: Pull request is created that references issue
   - **Then**: Move to "Review & Testing"

3. **Auto-move to "Done"**
   - **When**: Issue is closed
   - **Then**: Move to "Done"

#### **Field Configuration**

Add these custom fields:

1. **Priority** (Single select)

   - Options: Critical, High, Medium, Low
   - Color coding: Red, Orange, Yellow, Gray

2. **Effort** (Single select)

   - Options: XS (1-2 days), Small (3-5 days), Medium (1-2 weeks), Large (3-4 weeks)
   - Color coding: Light blue, Blue, Purple, Dark purple

### **Step 6: Configure Views**

#### **Board View (Default)**

- **Filter**: Show all issues

- **Sort by**: Priority (High to Low)

#### **Planning View (Table)**

Create a second view:

- **Type**: Table
- **Name**: "Sprint Planning"
- **Columns**: Title, Assignee, Priority, Effort, Platform, Status, Labels
- **Filter**: Phase 1 issues only
- **Sort**: Priority, then Effort

#### **Timeline View**

Create a third view:

- **Type**: Timeline
- **Name**: "Roadmap"
- **Group by**: Phase
- **Show**: All issues with target dates

### **Step 7: Set Up Milestones Integration**

Although we created issue #10 as a milestone tracker, you can also create actual GitHub milestones:

1. Go to **Issues** ‚Üí **Milestones** ‚Üí **New milestone**
2. Create these milestones:

**Phase 1: Foundation + Social**

- **Title**: "Phase 1: Foundation + Social"
- **Due date**: August 31, 2025
- **Description**: "Core acquisition features with social integration"

**Phase 2: Social Growth Engine**

3. Assign issues to appropriate milestones

## üéØ **Project Board Usage Workflow**

### **Daily Workflow**

1. **Morning Standup**: Review "In Progress" column
2. **Work Assignment**: Move issues from "Refined & Ready" to "In Progress"
3. **Progress Updates**: Update issue status and move cards as needed
4. **Code Review**: Items move automatically to "Review & Testing" when PRs created

### **Weekly Planning**

1. **Monday**: Sprint planning using "Sprint Planning" table view
2. **Wednesday**: Mid-week check-in and blocker resolution
3. **Friday**: Sprint review and next week preparation

### **Sprint Ceremonies**

1. **Sprint Planning**: Use table view to assign effort and prioritize
2. **Daily Standups**: Use board view to see current progress
3. **Sprint Review**: Use timeline view to track milestone progress
4. **Retrospective**: Analyze completed items and process improvements

## üìä **Project Monitoring & Metrics**

### **Built-in GitHub Insights**

Access via Project Settings ‚Üí Insights:

1. **Burndown Charts**: Track sprint progress
2. **Velocity Tracking**: Measure team output over time
3. **Cycle Time**: Time from start to completion
4. **Lead Time**: Time from creation to completion

### **Custom Dashboards**

Create views for different stakeholders:

**Engineering View**

- Filter: Technical issues only
- Columns: Assignee, Priority, Platform, Status
- Sort: By assignee, then priority

**Product View**

- Filter: Feature issues only
- Columns: Feature, Priority, Effort, Success Metrics

## üîß **Advanced Configuration**

### **GitHub Actions Integration**

Create automation workflows:

```yaml

name: Project Board Automation

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, closed, assigned]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  update_project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Move assigned issues to In Progress
        # Add GitHub CLI commands to move cards
      - name: Move PR issues to Review
        # Add logic to move related issues
```

### **Label-Based Automation**

Use labels to trigger moves:

- `status: in-progress` ‚Üí Auto-move to "In Progress"
- `status: review` ‚Üí Auto-move to "Review & Testing"
- `status: blocked` ‚Üí Add red indicator
- `priority: critical` ‚Üí Move to top of column

### **Integration with External Tools**

- **Slack**: Project update notifications
- **Linear**: Bi-directional sync (if needed)
- **Notion**: Documentation links
- **Figma**: Design file attachments
