# Site Form UI/UX Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the site form interface for better user experience and visual appeal.

## Changes Made

### 1. ImageInput Component Enhancement (mint-ui)

**Problem:** The original ImageInput component had a confusing interface with no clear "Choose file" button, making it unclear how users should upload images.

**Solution:**

- Added a proper "Choose File" button using the mint-ui Button component
- Improved image preview with proper sizing and borders
- Changed button text to "Change Image" when an image is already selected
- Better visual hierarchy and spacing

**Before:**

- Clickable div with "Upload an image" text (confusing)
- Full-width image preview (took too much space)

**After:**

- Clear "Choose File" / "Change Image" button
- Compact image preview with proper sizing (max-width: 300px, height: 128px)
- Better visual feedback for user interactions

### 2. Site Form Layout Redesign (my-web)

**Problem:** The original site form had poor visual hierarchy, cramped layout, and was not user-friendly.

**Solution:**

- **Structured Layout:** Split into logical sections with clear headings
- **Better Typography:** Added section titles and descriptions
- **Improved Spacing:** Better use of whitespace and spacing between elements
- **Responsive Design:** Added responsive grid layouts for form elements
- **Visual Separation:** Used borders and sections to separate logo settings from text content
- **Container Width:** Added max-width constraint for better readability

**Layout Structure:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ General Information Section         │
│ ├─ Domain input                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Language-Specific Content Section   │
│ ├─ Language tabs                    │
│ ├─ Text content (Name, Description) │
│ ├─ Logo Settings                    │
│ │   ├─ Light Logo                   │
│ │   └─ Dark Logo                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Component Organization

**Improved Structure:**

- **Section Headers:** Clear headings for each form section
