## Automated Security Features Already Configured

### Files Created/Updated:

1. **`.github/dependabot.yml`** - Automated dependency updates for all components
2. **`.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`** - Enhanced CodeQL scanning configuration
3. **`SECURITY.md`** - Security policy and vulnerability reporting process
4. **`.github/workflows/security-audit.yml`** - Weekly security audits (from CI/CD setup)

### Security Scanning Integration:

- **Trivy vulnerability scanner** in CI/CD pipeline
- **CodeQL analysis** on pull requests and pushes
- **Dependency auditing** in all package managers
- **Container security scanning** for Docker images
- **SARIF result uploads** to GitHub Security tab

## Manual Steps Required

### 1. Enable GitHub Security Features

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings > Security & analysis**
3. Enable all the features listed in section 1 above

### 2. Configure Branch Protection

1. Go to **Settings > Branches**
2. Add protection rule for `main` branch
3. Configure settings as listed in section 2 above

### 3. Set up Notifications

1. Go to **Settings > Notifications**
2. Configure security alert notifications
3. Set up email notifications for Dependabot alerts

### 4. Review Security Advisories

1. Visit the **Security** tab in your repository
2. Review any existing advisories
3. Set up automated scanning schedules

## Verification Steps

After enabling all features, verify the setup:

1. **Check Security Tab**: Ensure all scanning tools are active
2. **Test Dependabot**: Wait for weekly updates or manually trigger
3. **Verify Branch Protection**: Try pushing directly to main (should be blocked)
4. **Test Secret Scanning**: Try committing a dummy API key (should be blocked)
5. **Review CodeQL Results**: Check for any security findings

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:

- Review Dependabot PRs weekly
- Monitor CodeQL findings
- Update security configurations as needed
- Review and respond to security advisories
- Audit access permissions quarterly

### Security Review Schedule:

- **Daily**: Monitor security alerts and notifications
- **Weekly**: Review Dependabot updates and security scan results
- **Monthly**: Review access permissions and branch protection rules
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive security audit and policy review
