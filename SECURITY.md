## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to:

- Email: security@tekminewe.com
- GitHub Security Advisory: Use the "Security" tab in this repository

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

## Security Measures

### Dependency Management

- All dependencies are regularly updated and audited
- `pnpm audit` is run in CI/CD pipelines
- Dependabot is enabled for automated security updates

### Code Scanning

- CodeQL analysis runs on all pull requests and pushes
- Trivy vulnerability scanner checks for container vulnerabilities
- SARIF results are uploaded to GitHub Security tab

### Environment Security

- Production secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets
- Environment variables are properly scoped and encrypted
- No sensitive data is committed to version control

### Authentication & Authorization

- Multi-factor authentication required for maintainers
- Branch protection rules enforce code review requirements
- Signed commits are encouraged for all contributors

### Infrastructure Security

- Docker images use non-root users where possible
- AWS resources follow least-privilege access principles
- Network policies restrict unnecessary service communication
