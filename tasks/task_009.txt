# Task ID: 9
# Title: Update mint-ui package.json
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove @radix-ui/themes dependency from package.json
# Details:
Update the mint-ui package.json to remove the @radix-ui/themes dependency. Tasks include:
1. Remove @radix-ui/themes from dependencies
2. Update README documentation regarding theming
3. Verify the package builds correctly without the dependency

# Progress:
- Confirmed that @radix-ui/themes has already been removed from package.json dependencies
- Verified that the package.json dependencies do not include @radix-ui/themes
- While dependencies have been removed, imports in components still need to be updated

# Test Strategy:
- Verify the package builds successfully without the @radix-ui/themes dependency
- Ensure all component files using @radix-ui/themes have been migrated to use custom theme components
- Update documentation to reflect the new theming approach
