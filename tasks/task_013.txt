# Task ID: 13
# Title: Comprehensive testing of theme implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Thoroughly test the theme implementation and toggle functionality
# Details:
Thoroughly test the theme implementation and toggle functionality across the application. Tasks include:
1. Testing theme toggle behavior in different browsers
2. Verifying that theme persists across page refreshes
3. Testing that the default theme respects user's system preference
4. Verifying that all components render correctly in both themes
5. Testing theme transitions and performance
6. Ensuring accessibility standards are maintained in both themes

# Test Results:
1. Theme Toggle Behavior:
   - Tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
   - Toggle works consistently across browsers
   - Icon changes appropriately when theme changes

2. Theme Persistence:
   - Theme selection persists across page refreshes
   - localStorage properly stores the theme preference
   - Theme is restored correctly on page reload

3. System Preference Detection:
   - Default theme correctly respects system preference
   - Tested with both light and dark system themes
   - Fallback to light theme works when no preference is detected

4. Component Rendering:
   - All components render correctly in both light and dark themes
   - Colors and contrasts are appropriate in both themes
   - No visual regressions were found

5. Theme Transitions and Performance:
   - Theme changes are smooth without flickering
   - Performance is not affected by theme changes
   - No significant render delays when switching themes

6. Accessibility:
   - ThemeToggle has proper aria-label for screen readers
   - Color contrasts meet WCAG standards in both themes
   - Focus indicators are visible in both themes
   - Keyboard navigation works correctly

# Conclusion:
The custom theme implementation is working correctly across all test cases. The ThemeProvider, useTheme hook, and ThemeToggle components work as expected, and all components render properly in both light and dark themes. The theme persists correctly, and accessibility standards are maintained.
