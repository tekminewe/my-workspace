# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create test strategy for theme changes
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a testing approach for validating theme replacements
# Details:
Define a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure theme functionality remains intact. Include:
1. Visual regression testing approach
2. Theme switching testing methods
3. Dark mode testing
4. Ensure components retain their styled appearance

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual Regression Testing:
   - Manual visual inspection of all components before and after changes
   - Compare component appearance in both light and dark themes
   - Validate spacing, colors, typography, and layout consistency
   - Document baseline appearance for reference

2. Theme Switching Testing:
   - Test ThemeToggle component functionality
   - Verify theme changes apply immediately to all components
   - Test theme persistence across page refreshes via localStorage
   - Verify smooth transitions between themes without flickering
   - Test programmatic theme changes using the useTheme hook

3. Dark Mode Testing:
   - Verify dark mode detection from system preferences
   - Test manual override of system preferences
   - Ensure all components maintain proper contrast in dark mode
   - Verify accessibility of dark theme (color contrast ratios)
   - Test dark mode across different browsers

4. Component Styling Verification:
   - Test all components that previously used Radix UI themes
   - Verify custom implementations match original styling
   - Test responsive behavior in both themes
   - Verify interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled)
   - Test component composition and nesting

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify keyboard navigation in both themes
   - Test screen reader compatibility
   - Ensure focus indicators are visible in both themes
   - Verify ARIA attributes work correctly

This strategy has been implemented throughout the theme migration process and has helped ensure a successful transition from @radix-ui/themes to our custom theme implementation.
