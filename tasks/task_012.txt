# Title: Implement theme toggle in navbar
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Add dark/light theme toggle next to login button in navbar
# Details:
Add a theme toggle button to the navbar next to the login button. Tasks include:
1. Creating a theme toggle component with dark/light mode icons
2. Placing the toggle in the navbar next to the login button
3. Connecting the toggle to the theme provider
4. Implementing localStorage persistence for theme selection (already done in ThemeProvider)
5. Ensuring the toggle reflects the current theme state

# Implementation:
- Successfully implemented the ThemeToggle component that uses the useTheme hook
- Used sun/moon icons from react-icons (FiSun and FiMoon) for light/dark mode
- The toggle component is already correctly placed in the Navbar component next to the login button
- The toggle shows the correct icon based on current theme
- Theme persistence works correctly using localStorage

# Test Strategy:
- Verified that clicking the toggle changes the theme
- Confirmed that the toggle shows the correct icon for each theme
- Verified theme persistence works between page refreshes
- Tested the visual appearance in both light and dark modes
- Added appropriate aria-label to ensure accessibility

# Status:
This task is complete. The ThemeToggle component is implemented in both mint-ui and my-web, and it's correctly placed in the navbar next to the login button.
