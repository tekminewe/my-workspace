# Task ID: 1
# Title: Audit @radix-ui/themes usage in mint-ui
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 
# Priority: high
# Description: Identify how @radix-ui/themes is used in the mint-ui library
# Details:
This task involves analyzing the mint-ui codebase to identify where and how @radix-ui/themes is being used. Create a comprehensive inventory that includes:
1. Which files import @radix-ui/themes
2. What specific features of @radix-ui/themes are being used (CSS variables, theme context, etc.)
3. How theming is implemented throughout the components
4. Assess the complexity of replacing @radix-ui/themes while maintaining the current theming capabilities

# Findings:
Completed the audit of @radix-ui/themes usage in mint-ui. Here's a summary of the findings:

1. Files importing @radix-ui/themes:
   - grid/grid.tsx
   - badge/badge.tsx
   - product-list/product-list.tsx
   - text-input/text-input.tsx
   - product-item/product-item.tsx
   - data-table/data-table.tsx
   - icon-button/icon-button.tsx
   - post-item/post-item.tsx
   - select/select.tsx
   - mobile-navigation-menu/item.tsx
   - success-card/success-card.tsx
   - rich-text-editor/figure-bubble-menu.tsx
   - switch/switch.tsx
   - link/link.tsx
   - callout/callout.tsx
   - popover/popover.tsx
   - small-text/small-text.tsx
   - multi-select/multi-select.tsx
   - separator/separator.tsx
   - text-area/text-area.tsx
   - skeleton/skeleton.tsx

2. @radix-ui/themes features being used:
   - Component imports (Grid, Badge, Box, Card, Table, etc.)
   - Styling via Radix UI theme tokens
   - CSS variables for theming

3. Theming implementation:
   - Light/dark mode toggle using ThemeProvider
   - CSS variables for color schemes
   - Shared component styling via Radix UI themes

4. Complexity assessment:
   - Medium complexity to replace
   - Need to create custom implementations for each component
   - CSS variables already exist in the codebase for theming
   - Dark mode implementation is already working via ThemeProvider

# Implementation Strategy:
1. Replace simple components first (Badge, Grid)
2. Address complex components later
3. Utilize existing CSS variables in globals.css
4. Ensure the new components maintain the same API for backward compatibility
