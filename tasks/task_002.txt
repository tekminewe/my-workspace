# Task ID: 2
# Title: Analyze theming usage in my-web project
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 
# Priority: high
# Description: Examine how themes are used in the my-web project
# Details:
Analyze the my-web project to understand how it uses mint-ui theming. Tasks include:
1. Identify any theme customizations in the my-web project
2. Document how dark mode is implemented and switched
3. Look for any direct imports or references to @radix-ui/themes
4. Identify potential impact points when @radix-ui/themes is removed

# Findings:
Completed the analysis of theming usage in the my-web project. Here's a summary:

1. Theme Customizations:
   - The my-web project uses CSS variables in globals.css for theming
   - Comprehensive CSS variable definitions for light and dark modes (green, gray color schemes)
   - CSS variables are defined for color-contrast, color-surface, and other theme tokens

2. Dark Mode Implementation:
   - The my-web project uses ThemeProvider from mint-ui to manage theme state
   - A ThemeToggle component is implemented in the navbar
   - Dark mode class is applied to the document root element
   - User preferences are stored in localStorage under "mint-ui-theme"
   - System preference detection is implemented via the prefers-color-scheme media query

3. @radix-ui/themes References:
   - No direct imports of @radix-ui/themes were found in the my-web project
   - All theme-related functionality is imported from mint-ui

4. Potential Impact Points:
   - Theme-related components imported from mint-ui (ThemeToggle, ThemeProvider)
   - Component styling that relies on theme variables
   - The navbar component which includes the ThemeToggle

# Implementation Strategy:
- Continue using the current ThemeProvider implementation
- Keep the existing CSS variables structure which is already well-defined
- Ensure the ThemeToggle component continues to work with the custom theme implementation
