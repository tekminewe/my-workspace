# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design theme replacement strategy
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a strategic plan for replacing @radix-ui/themes
# Details:
Develop a comprehensive strategy for replacing @radix-ui/themes. This includes:
1. Deciding on the approach for theme implementation (CSS variables, context, etc.)
2. Establishing requirements for maintaining current theming capabilities
3. Planning for maintaining dark mode support
4. Creating a migration path that minimizes changes to component APIs

# Strategy:
Completed the design of the theme replacement strategy. Here's the plan:

1. Theme Implementation Approach:
   - Use CSS variables for theming
   - Create a React context-based ThemeProvider for managing theme state
   - Implement useTheme hook for accessing theme values and actions
   - Store theme preference in localStorage
   - Detect and respect user system preferences

2. Requirements for Maintaining Theming Capabilities:
   - Maintain support for light and dark modes
   - Keep the same color tokens and variable naming conventions
   - Ensure all components that used Radix theming still look consistent
   - Keep the same theme toggle functionality

3. Dark Mode Support:
   - Implement a theme context with light/dark mode toggle
   - Apply 'dark' class to the document root element
   - Use CSS variables with light/dark variants
   - Support system preference detection
   - Persist user preference in localStorage

4. Migration Path:
   - Replace simple components first (Grid, Badge)
   - Create custom implementations that match the Radix UI API
   - Use the existing CSS variables in globals.css
   - Ensure component props and functionality remain the same
   - Create new components for complex Radix UI components

# Implementation Progress:
- Created ThemeProvider, useTheme hook, and ThemeToggle components
- Implemented CSS variable-based theming
- Started component migration with Grid and Badge components
- Integrated theme toggle in the navbar
