# Task ID: 7
# Title: Update CSS variables and theme tokens
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Recreate necessary CSS variables and theme tokens
# Details:
Implement CSS variables and theme tokens to replace those from @radix-ui/themes. Tasks include:
1. Identify all theme tokens used from @radix-ui/themes
2. Create equivalent CSS variables
3. Implement light and dark theme variations
4. Update component styles to use the new variables

# Progress:
- Created a utility function (cn) for merging classnames using clsx and tailwind-merge
- Started replacing Radix UI components with custom implementations using CSS variables
- Implemented Grid and Badge components with custom theme variables
- Components now use CSS variables from the globals.css file which provide both light and dark mode support through the :root, .light-theme, and .dark-theme selectors
- Components are being migrated to use these variables which match the original color scheme

# Test Strategy:
- Verify component appearance in both light and dark mode
- Ensure components properly respond to theme changes
- Confirm components match the design specifications
